This prototype device detects motion and displays a positive phrase on an LCD display, accompanied by a heartbeat animation. Additionally, a small mascot integrated into the device will open the top lid in response to detected motion. The primary goal is to bring joy to kids and spread positivity.

What you'll need:
- Arduino Uno
- LCD 16x2
- Servo
- LED Matrix 8x8
- PIR sensor
- Cardboard
- Jumping wires

These are the positive sentences that are currently randomly displayed in the LCD:
- YOU GOT THIS
- YOU'RE LOVED
- YOU CAN DO IT
- YOU'RE SPECIAL
- YOU'RE BRAVE
