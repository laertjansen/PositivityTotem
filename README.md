The primary goal of this prototype is to bring joy to children and spread happiness through the use of positive words. The device detects motion and displays uplifting phrases on an LCD display, accompanied by a heartbeat animation. Additionally, a small mascot integrated into the device will open the top lid in response to detected motion within a 40 cm range.

What you'll need:
- Arduino Uno
- LCD 16x2
- Servo
- LED Matrix 8x8
- PIR sensor
- Cardboard
- Jumping wires

These are the positive sentences that are currently randomly displayed in the LCD:
- YOU GOT THIS
- YOU'RE LOVED
- YOU CAN DO IT
- YOU'RE SPECIAL
- YOU'RE BRAVE


Here are some screenshots of the process and the final box that I created in order to house all the components:
